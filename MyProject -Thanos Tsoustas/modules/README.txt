1. Before anything run "npm install" from the terminal.

2. Use live-server. Imports and exports can't 
   be used without the use of a server 

3. If you want to use express,
   comment out <script src="/src/app.js"/> and 
   use <script src="/dist/bundle.js"/>
   Run "npm start" and you are good to go.
